# UART-Receive-with-Interrupt-PIC16F877A
This project uses the PIC16F877A to receive serial data via UART at 9600 bps. Incoming data triggers an interrupt, stores the byte in a buffer, and displays it on PORTB (e.g., to LEDs). It's useful for interrupt-driven communication with PCs, sensors, or other microcontrollers
